VSTRING Library

VSTRING library provides vast set of string manipulation features
including dynamic string object that can be freely exchanged with
standard char* type, so there is no need to change function calls
nor the implementation when you change from char* to String (and
vice versa). The main difference from other similar libs is that
the dynamic String class has no visible methods (except operators)
so you will use it as a plain char* but it will expand/shrink as
needed. 

Thank you for the attention!
