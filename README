VSTRING is C++ string library. It provides dynamic strings and char* 
compatibility and also Perl-like arrays, hashes and regexp objects.

The dynamic string object can be freely exchanged with
standard char* type, so there is no need to change function calls
nor the implementation when you change from char* to String (and
vice versa). The main difference from other similar libs is that
the dynamic string class has no visible methods (except operators)
so you will use it as a plain char* but it will expand/shrink as
needed.
